# PTC-Project
#Kogi is an image recognition software used for gardening at home. Simply upload a picture of your plants and we'll tell you how ripe it and how to proceed with growing it.
#This project will require PIL, Numpy, and OpenCV (Python modules we used to code) to run
#This is a prototype to give proof that our idea works
#Made for Hack Your Tomorrow PTC Hackathon
